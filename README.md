# A-B-testing
This exercise is intended to perform A/B testing on a website to test whether the experiment yiled a better conversion rate for a website as compared to current theme.
The idea is to understand A/B testing  and its control variables.
Note:this is a very simple experiment.

Data was sourced from kaggle.

We conducted z -test on the chosen sample size data and the the p value was very high (0.7). Hence, the null hypothesis was rejected. The results proved that there was not much difference between the peroformance of old and new design. We were aiming for an improvement of atleast 25 (13% to 15%).
